This notes contain all the important info gathered during the development of this project. I have code out of the box 
by Max but Redux hasn't applied yet. In this we learn step by step how to apply redux and work with react-redux library.

1. Steps in general for redux :
   * The state is the universal state and is called central store. To the store, we pass reducer.
   * That reducer which we pass to store is called root reducer. We can combine multiple reducers into one, and 
     that combined one becomes the root reducer which is then passed into the store.
   * The action is dispatched into the reducer and the logic is written inside reducer which updates the store.
   * For example, if we want to increment the counter (counter is in store), then we dispatch increment action and 
     the increment logic is written in the reducer. This updates the store.
